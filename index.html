              <h2>Our Story</h2>
            </div>
            <p id="introText">Taqseem isn't just an organization – it's a dream come true. It all began with a heartfelt desire to give back to society, to empower individuals to stand tall and succeed. Imagine a world where the next generation grows up with passion, kindness, respect, and the ability to care for themselves and their community.

              This incredible journey took flight with a single photograph that struck a chord deep within Mr. Jahangir's heart. The image captured a father joyfully escorting his kids to school on a motorcycle, earning the title 'a real-life hero.' But it was the accompanying caption that truly resonated: "This picture means the world to me. My dad is my hero. He'd sit there with his newspaper, waiting to take me to school, even though it was just a minute away. Witnessing those kids brimming with excitement as they hopped onto the bike reminded me of my dad and all the unsung heroes we overlook every day."</p>

            <p id="additionalText" class="hidden">The photographer behind that impactful image was none other than Mr. Jahangir's daughter, Iman Jahangir, the current CEO of Taqseem Foundation. The weight of the 'real hero' title spurred Mr. Jahangir into action. He knew he needed to do something tangible. And so, he shared his feelings with Iman, saying, "Every parent treasures the act of taking their kids to school. Let's pledge to help parents who can't afford to do the same. If you win, use the funds for this purpose."

              With that promise, the transformative journey began. Mr. Jahangir and his daughter, Iman, embarked on a mission to offer free education to children in need. Despite challenges, they held fast to their determination to make a meaningful impact.
              
              Today, after three years and even amidst a pandemic, Taqseem stands as a testament to their commitment. Four thriving schools, 1100 students, and countless lives touched by their unwavering dedication. Starting modestly with their own resources, they are gradually making education accessible to more and more individuals.
              
              Taqseem's story is one of chasing a dream, confronting challenges head-on, and believing wholeheartedly in the power of education. From a single photograph to four flourishing schools, it's a narrative that demonstrates the significance of turning intentions into actions, effecting genuine change. Taqseem isn't just about offering assistance – it's about transforming lives, one step at a time. And this journey is far from over; Taqseem continues to expand, spreading education and hope.</p>

            free education to the underprivileged. Furthermore, Taqseem's
            overarching goal is to disseminate quality education and provide
            sustenance to marginalized communities through initiatives like
            Taqseem Ilm. Looking ahead, we are also planning to launch
            vocational training programs to empower women in the near future.
